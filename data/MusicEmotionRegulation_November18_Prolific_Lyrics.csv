5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,3,I sing to you
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,4,You don't exist
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,5,I sing to you though
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,6,"When I address you, who am I talking to?"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,7,Standing in the front yard like an open wound
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,8,"Repeating ""I love you"", to who?"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,9,I recorded all these songs about the echoes in our house now
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,10,And then walked out the door to play them on a stage
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,11,But I sing to you
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,12,I picture you
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,13,"When we first met, you were 22"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,14,And I drove my truck onto the ferry to Victoria in the morning
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,15,Where we met and talked forever in your apartment with evening falling
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,16,So I brought my blankets in and slept on the floor right next to your bed
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,17,"In the morning, barely awake, I saw you standing right above me"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,18,Peeling an orange and looking hungry
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,19,"""Do you want some,"" you asked me"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,20,And then just avalanched into me with pieces of orange
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,21,And weight and kissing and certainty
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,22,I remember you a few days later in Tofino
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,23,Where we'd driven to play a show you'd set up for us at a surf shop to no one
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,24,Then we slept in the back of my truck and got woken up by the cops
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,25,And so went down to the fishing boat docks to ask whoever for a ride
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,26,Across the water to Meares Island to just get left there for the day
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,27,"And we did, and brought some food to eat and went through the big trees"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,28,"Abandoned and in love, totally insane, apart from the rest of the world"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,29,We had finally found each other in the universe
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,30,"Lying on the rocks, waiting for the boat to come pick us up"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,31,I read the one book we had with us aloud
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,32,"With my head on your lap, sinking into you"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,33,Tintin in Tibet in French
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,34,And we thought of devotion and snow and distant longing in the Himalayan air
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,35,"High and cold, with a bell ringing out"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,36,"Then right before you died, thirteen years later in our house"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,37,"I remember, through your gasping for oxygen, you explained that you were thinking about that high, cold air"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,38,"Wrapping the globe, singing above the mountains of the gods"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,39,"And I do picture you there, molecules dancing"
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,40,But I'd rather you were in the house watching the unfolding everyday life of this good daughter we made
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,41,Instead of being scattered by the wind for no reason
5OrPX4sR9TFI9su2HikzQh,Mount Eerie,Tintin in Tibet,Tintin in Tibet,42,So I sing to you

6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,1,I walked through the door with you
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,2,The air was cold
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,3,"But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and ILeft my scarf there at your sister's house"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,4,And you've still got it
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,5,"In your drawer, even now"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,6,"Oh, your sweet disposition"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,7,And my wide-eyed gaze
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,8,We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,9,Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,10,And I can picture it after all these days
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,11,And I know it's long gone and
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,12,That magic's not here no more
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,13,"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,14,"Oh, oh, oh"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,15,'Cause there we are again on that little town street
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,16,You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,17,"Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,18,Photo album on the counter
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,19,Your cheeks were turning red
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,20,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,21,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,22,"You told me about your past, thinking your future was me"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,23,And I know it's long gone and
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,24,There was nothing else I could do
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,25,And I forget about you long enough
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,26,To forget why I needed to
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,27,'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,28,We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,29,"Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,30,Maybe we got lost in translation
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,31,Maybe I asked for too much
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,32,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,33,'Til you tore it all up
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,34,"Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,35,And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,36,So casually cruel in the name of being honest
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,37,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,38,"'Cause I remember it all, all, all"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,39,Too well
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,40,"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,41,I'd like to be my old self again
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,42,But I'm still trying to find it
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,43,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,44,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,45,But you keep my old scarf
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,46,From that very first week
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,47,'Cause it reminds you of innocence
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,48,And it smells like me
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,49,You can't get rid of it
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,50,"'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,51,'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,52,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,53,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,54,"Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,55,"Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all"
6GNRkaWUB0Lwc19SdkTgx8,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,All Too Well,56,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"

222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,27,Why we always at each other's throats?
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,28,"Especially when Dad, he fucked us both"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,29,We're in the same fuckin' boat
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,30,You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,31,"Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,32,"And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,33,"Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,34,"And I was the man of the house, the oldest"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,35,So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,36,Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,37,And that's when I realized you were sick
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,38,And it wasn't fixable or changeable
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,39,"And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,40,I guess we are who we are
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,41,"Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,42,Maybe we took this too far
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,43,"‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,44,‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,45,"But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"""
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,46,"At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,47,Never meant that far to take it though
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,48,"‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,49,That song I no longer play at shows
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,50,And I cringe every time it's on the radio
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,51,And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,52,And all the medicine you fed us and
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,53,How I just wanted you to taste your own
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,54,But now the medication's takin' over
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,55,And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,56,"And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,57,"But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,58,"All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,59,"Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,60,"But I love you, Debbie Mathers"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,61,"Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,62,One thing I never asked was
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,63,Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,64,"Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,65,"But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,66,Owned a collection of maps
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,67,And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,68,If someone ever moved 'em from me
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,69,That you coulda bet your asses
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,70,"If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,71,And although one has only met their grandma once
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,72,You pulled up in our drive one night
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,73,As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,74,"Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,75,And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,76,Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,77,I saw your headlights as I looked back
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,78,And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,79,Thank you for being my mom and my dad
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,80,"So, Mom, please accept this as a"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,81,"Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,82,"Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,83,"Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,84,"My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,85,"I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,86,I guess we are who we are
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,87,"Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,88,Maybe we took this too far
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,89,I want a new life (Start over)
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,90,One without a cause (Clean slate)
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,91,So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,92,"Well, no matter what the cost"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,93,And if the plane goes down
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,94,Or if the crew can't wake me up
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,95,"Well, just know that I'm alright"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,96,I was not afraid to die
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,97,"Oh, even if there's songs to sing"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,98,"Well, my children will carry me"
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,99,Just know that I'm alright
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,100,I was not afraid to die
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,101,Because I put my faith in my little girls
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,102,So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,103,Just know that I'm alright
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,104,I am not afraid to die
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,105,I guess we are who we are

222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,107,Maybe we took this too far
222dTwr5XeEgAzEtsrQA0R,Eminem,Headlights,Headlights,108,I want a new life

7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,9,Over the ramparts you tossed
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,10,The scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,11,Tied to a brick
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,12,Sweet as a song
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,13,The years have been short
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,14,But the days were long
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,15,Cool of a temperate breeze
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,16,From dark skies to wet grass
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,17,"We fell in a field, it seems now"
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,18,A thousand summers passed
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,19,When our kite lines first crossed
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,20,We tied 'em into knots
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,21,But to finally fly apart
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,22,We had to cut them off
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,23,Since then it's been a book
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,24,You read in reverse
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,25,So you understand less
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,26,As the pages turn
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,27,Or a movie so crass
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,28,And awkwardly cast
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,29,That even I could be the star
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,30,I don't look back much as a rule
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,31,And all this way before murder was cool
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,32,But your memory is here and I'd like it to stay
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,33,"Warm light, on a winter's day"
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,34,NA
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,35,Over the ramparts you tossed
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,36,The scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,37,Tied to a brick
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,38,Sweet as a song
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,39,The years have seemed short
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,40,But the days go slowly by
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,41,Two loose kites fallen from the sky
7LQyaNDtdmUGnaQYmL3xZu,The Shins,Pink Bullets,Pink Bullets,42,Drawn to the ground in an end to flight
