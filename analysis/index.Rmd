This site provides the script and some insight into my thoughts as writing/seeing the results. I have broken the site into 6 sections, one section of confirmatory tests adn one section of exploratory tests for each of the three studies. 

## Study One 
### [Confirmatory Tests](StudyOneConfirm.html)
### [Exploratory Tests](StudyOneExplore.html)

## Study Two 
### [Confirmatory Tests](StudyTwoConfirm.html)
### [Exploratory Tests](StudyTwoExplore.html)
