This project investigated how rumination was related to emotional outcomes of music listening in the context of sadness. We did this using two experiments and one cross-sectional survey. Data was also obtained from spotify about the songs participants listened to, or nominated as being likely listened to. 

The project has been broken down into it's constituent parts. 

Each study has a page containing confirmatory tests and another page containing exploratory tests. The results are annotated sporadically but this is primarlily intended to show the results rather than provide rich interpretation. 

THe manuscript will also be uplaoded to the site upon completion.
